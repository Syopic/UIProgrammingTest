So go ahead and hit CTRL+S to save and CTRL+E to Export to Engine.\nCongratulations, you've now successfully created your first level and are ready to start building it up!\nStep 2 - Terrain Building\n\nNow that we've got our level created, we can notice two basic elements that are in the world, Ocean and Terrain.\nThe Ocean can be set at a specific height, by default it's at 16m (from the lowest point of the heightmap, which is 0m).\nThe Terrain also sets itself at a default height of 32m, this is a new change to CRYENGINE 3.6 and gives you quick access to new levels without having to modify terrain or the ocean first.\nTerrain Generation\n\nThere are several ways you can work with terrain in CRYENGINE. You can import a heightmap such as a greyscale texture or from a dedicated application like World Machine, you can sculpt it manually with the built-in terrain tools or import it from another level but for this example we'll use the built in Terrain Generation tool to give us some quick and easy results.\nOpen the Terrain Editor from the Toolbar or View -> Open View Pane -> Terrain Editor.\nClick on the Generate Terrain button in the toolbar or Tools -> Generate Terrain.\n\nKeep the default settings for now and click OK.\nYou'll notice the heightmap shows the terrain height variance:\n\nIt looks like the terrain has gotten very large in scale now as the camera is now sitting inside the terrain.\nClose the Terrain Tool and pan the camera around to get a better overview:\n\nIcon\nUse WASD to move the camera, hold Right Mouse Button inside the viewport and move the mouse to pan the camera.\nOk this is definitely way too large in scale, so we'll bring down the maximum terrain height.\nOpen the Terrain Tool again and click Modify -> Set Terrain Max Height. Set it to 128 (meters). By default it's 1024m.\nYou can see it's chopped off the existing terrain, up to 128m high, which can actually be a pretty neat way to make canyon-type terrain:\n\nNow lets Generate the Terrain again which is going to give us much more suitable (scaled down) results with the new maximum height set:\n\nStep 3 - Terrain Textures Setup\n\nNow that we've got a basic terrain setup, lets add some textures. We'll start with just one grass layer for now. For more information on Terrain Texture setup, see: Painting Terrain.\nOpen the Terrain Texture Tool from the Toolbar or View -> Open View Pane -> Terrain Texture Layers.\n\nYou'll see the default layer that was mentioned earlier in this article which is generated on level creation.\nYou have the option to overwrite the existing layer texture/material, but its advised to create a new layer and delete the default one afterwards.\nClick on Add Layer in the left column. Double click on text where you can type in a new name for the layer to make it easily recognizable:\n\nAfter you've named the layer, click on Change Layer Texture above the texture preview image in the left column.\nThis should open the file dialog in the GameSDK\Textures\defaults folder. Select the grey.dds texture in there.\nThat's the Texture down, now we'll change the Material by clicking on the material for our layer. This will open the Material Editor:\n\nIn the Material Editor, navigate to Materials/terrain/grass_4 and select the material in the list:\n\nNow, back in the Terrain Texture Layers tool, with our new layer selected, click Assign Material in the left column.\nYou should see the linked material update to the grass_4 material:\n\nGreat, now you've got your first terrain layer setup! You can repeat these steps to add other layers in order to give your terrain variation and more realistic results.\nStep 4 - Painting Terrain\n\nFor the sake of speed, we're going to use a feature which was added in CRYENGINE 3.5.5 which is the  tool.\nDepending on how much space you've got on screen, it might be a good time to close the Material Editor and Terrain Tools to give you some more room.\nNow open the Terrain tools in the RollupBar and click on Layer Painter:\n\nIn the bottom section you'll see our two existing layers and the reason behind naming your layers appropriately.\nSelect the Grass layer and then click Flood at the bottom of the tool.\nYou'll notice the results don't look very convincing with the default settings.\n\nThis is because the only color its getting is from the very limited amount of green in the high-passed texture in the grass_4 material.\nWe should be getting most of the color for our terrain from the base texture (grey.dds). Because it's a grey texture though, we're going to add some green through the layer painter tool.\nClick on Reset above the Color tool to reset the default brightness then click on the Color tool to open it.\nSee the image below for a recommended starting point, but this will of course require tweaking and testing to suit your level and scene.\n\nStart with something fairly dark and fairly desaturated as we already have quite a bit of green showing by default.\nWith our new color/brightness set, click Save Layer to save the settings, otherwise they'll be reset if you deselect the layer/tool.\nNow repaint the terrain with the Flood tool. You can see from the new settings we're getting a bit closer:\n\nDon't be too concerned about the lighting yet, it is a balancing act between various elements and we'll start balancing that out a bit "
